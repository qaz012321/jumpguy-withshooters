**GamePlay Description:** rules, goals, levels(if applicable), UML class diagrams

You are hallucinating and you want it to stop. Leave each place through a door to get to the next place

E.g. moving character, moving enemies, stationary enemies, shooting/bullets, death zones, jumping & gravity, scrolling bg, point/score system, time system, levels, end zone, boss(maybe?), pausing(maybe?)


**Describe user  
interactions**
- 8 possible keys to move
- 1 key to shoot
- 1 key to pause?
- Mouse to select option on title screen and menus


**Which techniques** do you  need for implementation (At least one)
Y=Yes   M=Maybe/Unsure

Collision           = Y
Gravity/Jumping     = Y

image rotation
moving at an angle

background scroll   = Y
relative movement   = Y
Fixed object        = Y
animated character  = M
Tracking time       = Y
Array list          = M

Tile based game

mouse selection     = Y
Shooting            = Y


**Timeline**
1st Draft - design, game plan    - Dec 25
2nd Draft - functional code      - Jan 15
Final - debug/testing            - Jan 20
